            <b>Abstraction</b> is one of the 4 main OOP principles.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            The objective is to present only the necessary information to the user.
            The unnecessary details remain hidden.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example numeric-rows"><?php
class Triangle
{
    private $a;
    private $b;
    private $c;

    public function __construct($aVal, $bVal, $cVal)
    {
        $this->a = $aVal;
        $this->b = $bVal;
        $this->c = $cVal;
    }

    public function calcArea()
    {
        $a = $this->a;
        $b = $this->b;
        $c = $this->c;

        $p = ($a + $b + $c) / 2;
        $area = sqrt($p * ($p - $a) * ($p - $b) * ($p - $c));

        return $area;
    }
}

$triangle = new Triangle(3, 4, 5);
echo "Area = " . $triangle->calcArea();</textarea>
        <p>Result:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example text-only">Area = 6</textarea>

        <p>In this example the person who uses the class is only concerned about the area
            of the triangle.</p>
        <p>The one who uses the class doesn't care about the way an area
            is calculated. The important information is the calculated area.
            The details that remain hidden are the calculations for the area.</p>
