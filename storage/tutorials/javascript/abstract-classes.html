        <h2 class="h4 my-3">Abstract Class</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Abstract Class</b> is a class that can't
            be instantiated (objects cannot be created).</p>
        <p>It's supposed to represent something abstract and not specific.</p>

        <p>Let's look at the following example:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example numeric-rows">class Vehicle
{
    getInsuranceCost(months){
        return  0;
    }

    constructor() {
        if (this.constructor === Vehicle) {
            throw new Error('Abstract class "Vehicle" cannot be instantiated directly.');
        }
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Overwriting method
    getInsuranceCost(months)
    {
        return 25 * months;
    }
}

class Bicycle extends Vehicle {}

// let vehicle = new Vehicle();
let car = new Car();
console.log( "Car's Year Insurance: " + car.getInsuranceCost(12) + " $");

let bicycle = new Bicycle();
console.log( "Bike's Year Insurance: " + bicycle.getInsuranceCost(12) + " $");
</textarea>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example text-only">Car's Year Insurance: 300 $
Bike's Year Insurance: 0 $</textarea>
        <p>Explanation</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The abstract class <code>Vehicle</code>
                is defined at <code>lines 1-12</code>.</li>
            <li>The name of the abstract class is <code>Vehicle</code>.
                This is something indefinite and it's inherited by other classes.</li>
            <li>If we uncomment <code>line 24</code> the code won't
                compile. That's due to the error set at <code>line 9</code>.</li>
        </ul>
