        <h2 class="h4 my-3">Getters</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Getters</b> give public access to private data. They may also make
            a small modification of the returned result.</p>
        <p>Let's look the following example:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example numeric-rows"><?php
class Square
{
    // default value for side
    private $side = 1;

    public function getSide() {
        return $this->side;
    }
}

$square = new Square();

// $square->side;
echo $square->getSide();</textarea>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example text-only">1</textarea>
        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If we uncomment <code>line 14</code> the code will not compile. That's because
                a private member (declared at <code>line 5</code>) cannot be directly accessed
                outside the class body.</li>
            <li>At <code>line 15</code> a private member is accessed outside the class body.
                That's not done directly (like in <code>line 14</code>) but through a public function
                - a getter. This is how a private member can be accessed outside the class body.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's add more stuff:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example numeric-rows"><?php
class Square
{
    // default value for side
    private $side = 2.5;

    public function getSide()
    {
        return $this->side;
    }

    public function getPerimeter()
    {
        return $this->side * 4;
    }

    public function getArea()
    {
        return $this->side * $this->side;
    }
}

$square = new Square();

echo "Side = " . $square->getSide() . "\n";
echo "Perimeter = " . $square->getPerimeter() . "\n";
echo "Area = " . $square->getArea() . "\n";</textarea>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example text-only">Side = 2.5
Perimeter = 10
Area = 6.25</textarea>
        <p>The only things that were added are 2 getters - <code>getPerimeter</code> and
            <code>getArea</code>. Simply they are getters that return a private member
            with a small modification.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 my-3">Setters</h2>
        <p class="note"><b>Setters</b> allow for a private variable to be modified.
            They are important since they can provide validation
            before a value is set.</p>
        <p> Let's look at the following example:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example numeric-rows"><?php
class Person
{
    private $name;
    private $age;

    public function getName()
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getAge()
    {
        return $this->age;
    }

    // basic setter function:
    public function setName($nameNewValue)
    {
        $this->name = $nameNewValue;
    }

    // setter function with validation:
    public function setAge($ageNewValue)
    {
        if ($ageNewValue < 0) {
            $this->age = 0;
        }

        // set the new value
        $this->age = $ageNewValue;
    }

    public function printData()
    {
        echo "Name: " . $this->name . "\n";
        echo "Age: " .  $this->age . "\n";
    }
}

$person = new Person();
$person->setName("Emily");
$person->setAge(20);
// $person->setAge(-1);
$person->printData();</textarea>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <textarea class="tutorial-example text-only">Name: Emily
Age: 20</textarea>
        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Value of the private member <code>name</code> is
                modified at <code>line 20</code> without any validation.
            </li>
            <li>At <code>lines 24 - 32</code> is defined a setter that has validation.
                If the validation fails a value of <code>0</code> is set at <code>line 27</code>. If validation passes
                <code>(age >= 0)</code> then the passed value is set (<code>line 31</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
                If we uncomment <code>line 52</code>, then
                the person object's age will have a value of zero. That's due to the validation at <code>line 26</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 my-3">Why using getters and setters?</h2>
        <p class="note">Because private members can have validation before modification (setter) and
            controlled access (getter).</p>
        <p>It seems easier to have only public members. This way there is no need for getters
            and setters. It's a better practice to have private members that are
            accessed with getter and modified through setter. This way a validation can be
            provided in a setter and the public access can be done only to some members -
            those which have getters.</p>
